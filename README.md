# Workman-preserve
A small modification of the [Workman keyboard-layout](http://workmanlayout.org/).
I changed the layout in a way that the most common keyboard shortcuts (ctrl + x/c/v/a) and most of the special characters stay the same as on a regular German keyboard.
Furthermore the German characters ä, ö, ü, ß are still accessible via Alt Gr + a/o/u/s.
